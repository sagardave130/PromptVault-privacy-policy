    <h1>Privacy Policy for PromptVault Chrome Extension</h1>

    <p class="date">Last Updated: 4-jun-25</p>

    <p>Thank you for using PromptVault (the "Extension"), developed by Sagar ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of the Extension.</p>
    <p>By installing and using the Extension, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect (and How It's Stored)</h2>
    <p>PromptVault is designed with your privacy in mind. The Extension primarily handles information that you, the user, create and input directly into it. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Prompts:</strong> The text of the AI prompts you save, including any categories, tags, or variable placeholders you assign.</li>
        <li><strong>Extension Settings:</strong> Your preferences within the Extension, such as dark mode settings and default sort order.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>All this information is stored locally on your computer within your Chrome browser's secure local storage (`chrome.storage.local`). This data is not transmitted to, collected by, or stored on any external servers or databases controlled by us or any third party.</strong></p>
    <p>The Extension also utilizes the `contextMenus`, `activeTab`, and `scripting` permissions to allow you to save selected text from webpages as new prompts. This selected text is processed temporarily to create a new prompt entry within the Extension's local storage and is not stored or transmitted elsewhere by us beyond this local saving action initiated by you.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information stored by the Extension is used solely to provide you with the core functionality of PromptVault, which includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Saving, organizing, and managing your AI prompts.</li>
        <li>Allowing you to categorize, tag, edit, and search your prompts.</li>
        <li>Enabling features like favoriting prompts and using template variables.</li>
        <li>Remembering your user interface preferences (e.g., dark mode).</li>
        <li>Allowing you to import and export your prompt data (as JSON files stored locally on your device).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not access, analyze, or use the content of your saved prompts for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information or the content of your prompts to any third parties.</strong></p>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. The Extension does not automatically share this data with anyone, including us.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We rely on the security mechanisms provided by the Google Chrome browser and its `chrome.storage.local` API to protect the information stored by the Extension on your local device. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, please remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and the security of locally stored data ultimately also depends on the security of your own computer and browser environment.</p>

    <h2>5. User Control and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over the data stored by the Extension:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can edit or delete individual prompts at any time using the Extension's interface.</li>
        <li>You can export all your prompts as a local JSON file.</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the Extension will typically remove all data stored by it within your browser's local storage. You can also manually clear browser data associated with the Extension through Chrome's settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold if applicable in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with information, please contact us, and we will take steps to remove it.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of the Extension after any modifications to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
